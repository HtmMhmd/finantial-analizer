extract_documents:
  description: >
    Ingest every supplied document from {file_paths} using LandingAI ADE and deliver a
    lossless, structured JSON payload. For each file capture text spans, key-value
    pairs, tables (with headers, units, footnotes), attachments, and provenance
    metadata (filename, page, section anchors). Validate OCR confidence and log
    unreadable or low-confidence content in an issues list. Normalize monetary
    values to their stated currency and explicitly note any conversions performed.
  expected_output: >
    "JSON array where each element contains metadata, key_value_pairs, tables, narratives, attachments, and issues while preserving original context and units"
  agent: document_extractor


analyze_financial_data:
  description: >
    Convert {{ extract_documents.output }} into the requested {analysis_type} deliverable. Begin by
    validating data completeness against required statements and metrics. Compute
    profitability, liquidity, leverage, efficiency, cash coverage, and growth ratios,
    noting assumptions and adjustments. Evaluate covenant compliance, risk signals,
    and forward-looking scenarios (base, downside, upside). Summarize the material
    drivers impacting stakeholders and flag data gaps that require clarification.
  expected_output: >
    "Structured JSON with sections: executive_summary, metrics (with formula, value, source), analysis_notes, risk_assessment, scenario_analysis, recommendations, data_gaps"

  output_file: output/{analysis_type}_analyze.md
  

generate_report:
  description: >
    Transform {{ analyze_financial_data.output }} into a stakeholder-ready report aligned with the provided
    format guidelines. Translate each analysis section into clear prose, highlight
    top decisions, embed accessible tables or charts placeholders for key metrics,
    reference original document sources, and elevate urgent risks or opportunities
    with call-outs. Ensure the narrative flows logically from executive summary to
    appendix and that accessibility best practices are applied.
    
    IMPORTANT: After generating the complete report, you MUST use the pushover_notifier
    tool to send a notification to stakeholders. The notification should include:
    - Title: Brief description of the analysis type (e.g., "Personal Loan Analysis Complete")
    - Message: Executive summary with key findings, critical metrics, and top recommendations
  expected_output: >
    "Markdown document containing Executive Summary, Company Snapshot, Financial Highlights, 
    Risk & Compliance, Scenario Analysis, Recommendations, Appendix with cited sources.
    Additionally, a Pushover notification must be sent with the executive summary and key findings."
