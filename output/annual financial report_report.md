## Risk & Compliance  

| Risk Category | Assessment | Potential Impact |
|---------------|------------|------------------|
| **Liquidity Risk** | Heavy reliance on cash reserves; cash fell by €2.5 M in 2019. | May limit ability to fund charitable programmes if cash inflows stagnate. |
| **Investment Risk** | Large swing in *Movement in Social Investments* (‑76 % YoY). | Volatility could erode fund base. |
| **Operational Risk** | Dependence on donated professional services (KPMG, Abbey Capital). | Loss of services would increase out‑of‑pocket costs. |
| **Governance Risk** | Limited detail on advisory fees for accountants/legal. | Potential hidden costs; compliance monitoring needed. |

*Compliance:* The report follows UK charity reporting standards; however, several OCR‑related data gaps (see Section *Data Gaps*) should be verified for audit completeness.

## Scenario Analysis  

| Scenario | Description | Expected Outcome |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Base** | Expenditure and income remain flat; cash continues to decline without new funding. | Further reduction in total funds next year. |
| **Downside** | Donations fall, investment losses increase, unexpected costs arise. | Sharp fund depletion, possible curtailment of programmes. |
| **Upside** | Boost in donations & investment returns; efficiency gains reduce costs. | Stabilisation or growth of total funds; capacity to expand activities. |

---  

## Recommendations  

| Priority | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| **High** | **Develop a comprehensive fundraising strategy** to diversify income streams and reduce dependence on cash reserves. |
| **Medium** | **Implement operational efficiency initiatives** (e.g., expense review, process automation) to curb unnecessary spending. |
| **Medium** | **Diversify the investment portfolio** to mitigate concentration risk in social‑impact assets. |
| **Low** | **Formalise agreements with KPMG and Abbey Capital** for donated services to ensure continuity and evaluate alternatives. |

## Data Gaps & Further Investigation  

1. Detailed breakdown of **“Other income”** – missing from the Statement of Financial Activities.  
2. Clarification of **restrictions on “Unrestricted funds”** – needed for fund‑use planning.  
3. Explanation for the **significant decline in “Movement in Social Investments”** (‑76 % YoY).  
4. Missing **advisory fee details** for accountants and legal services (see Note on page 28).
